            The Heroic Poetic Society is a Unique Community of NFT enthusiasts
            that enjoys combining several art forms such as Poetry, Music, and
            Singing along with digital art to fully express and honor the human
            experience. We will be establishing ourselves in the NFT Community
            by dropping several collections that honor and catalog the real life
            human experience as we enjoy sharing our talents as a community. The
            first collection will be the &quot;Medical Heroes Collection.&quot;
            We can not possibly transition into WEB 3 without ensuring that our
            Worldwide Medical Community is acknowledged and honored forever for
            their heroic accomplishments by being minted on the ETH Blockchain.
            This will be the first collection to do just that! It is a NFT
            collection of 10,000 unique ERC-721 tokens stored on the Ethereum
            Blockchain to remember how each and every doctor and nurse literally
            had to &quot;suit up&quot; to take care of us! Each will be computer
            generated from over 100 + hand drawn traits consisting of various
            rarities and will be non-sequentially minted at one price for fair
            distribution . Each NFT comes with exclusive rights and a membership
            to the Heroic Poet Society Community, including functioning
            utilities, and an ever-growing community. The possibilities are
            limitless!
